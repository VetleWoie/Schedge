Meeting for Marte and Alex.

Discuss implementation plans to be executed during next work session (which will be thursday 11.02.2021).
- Archive:
	-Move past events to archive DB so they are not considered when querying for new/upcoming events.
- My events:
	- User ID = HOST:
		- Test cases:
			- Get 'my events' if userID matches.
		-  (Future: include status - number of answers, edit event, terminate requests to conclude numer/which participents.)

- Upcoming:
	- Host:
		- Upcoming events that userID is hosting.
	- Participant:
		- Upcoming events that userID is a participant of. (Has accepted invitation)
	
	- Test cases:
		- Get 'upcoming events' where userID is either host or participant.

- Event:
	- Include GroupID
- Group:
	- Create 'group' table to include participants with:
		- userID
		- groupID
		- eventID
		- hostID (?)
		- If a participant is in several groups a new entry of userID with the different groupID is created.

TODO:
	- add userID to event model.
	- Testcase ^
	- Create group model
	- Upcoming events - query host
	- Upcoming events - query participant.
